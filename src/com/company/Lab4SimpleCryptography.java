     * In the lecture we learned how some simple substitution ciphers work. We are going to build a program that lets you encrypt some basic text.
     *
     * 1.	Start a new java project for this. We will build on it week by week. Call it something that makes sense.
     * 2.	Think about the best way to structure your program – should you make an object? A utility class?
     * 3.	Start by making a test – define a string, decide a key (use a Caeser cipher – key should be 3), define what the encrypted text
     *      should equal if it’s encrypted properly.
     * 4.	Write the algorithm to encrypt the text. Test it.
     * 5.	Now write the algorithm to decrypt the text. Test it too.
     * 6.	Your algorithms should accept any number as a key – if they don’t already then fix this now.
     * 7.	Test with several numbers – make sure you’re handling the modulo 26 correctly.
