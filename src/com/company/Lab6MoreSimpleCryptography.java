     * Lab 6 – More Simple Cryptography
     *
     * In the last lab we made a program that can encrypt a String using the Caeser cipher, or another shift key chosen by the user.
     * If this isn’t complete go back and finish it.
     *
     *
     * 1.	This week we will extend this program to encrypt a text file.
     *      You should have a menu working that lets you encrypt a password – extend this menu to let you open a text file and encrypt the contents.
     * 2.	Test it
     * 3.	Add another menu item to let you decrypt the file contents.
     * 4.	Test it
     * 5.	Now add a menu option to brute force decrypting the file given a word that you know is contained in the file, for example, if the word “Hello” is in the file you should try each key in the alphabet until you find the word ‘Hello’ in the resulting text. You should then print out the key and decrypted text.
     * 6.	Test it
